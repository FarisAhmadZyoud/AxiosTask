The Main differnces between Fetch and Axisos tHAT I Noticed : 
Fetch : no need to insall specific Package 
Axios : its need to install Packge 
Fetch : when reciving response we must use respnse.json 
Axios : the respnse configured direct to json file 
The syntax of axios Easer than Fetch 
in axios I did not use Async and Await 
in axios all information returned in data attribuite also has additional attribuite suchas (status statusText headers, config)
in Fetch just returned the data in API Body .
